# Build script for all OSSIM repositories
#
# This script can be run from anywhere. It performs three functions:
# 
#   1. If running in an interactive shell, it queries for user for a build type
#      (Release, Debug, etc.),
#   2. It invokes the cmake configuration script to generate Makefiles in the
#      build directory.
#   3. It builds all OSSIM code.
#
# No env vars need to be predefined. The build output will be written to
# $OSSIMLABS_DIR/build/<build_type> where $OSSIMLABS_DIR is the top-level
# folder containing all OSSIM repositories (including this one).
#
# For customized output location, you can define the env var OSSIM_BUILD_DIR
# prior to running this script, and the output will be written there.
