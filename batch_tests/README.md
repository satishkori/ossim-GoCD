# OSSIM Batch Test Scripts

The *.kwl files in this directory are configuration scripts for the ossim-batch-test executable. The format for the command line is
```
ossim-batch-test <test-configuration-file.kwl>
```
There are two required environment variables referenced by ossim-batch-test and associated config scripts, namely, 

`OSSIM_BATCH_TEST_DATA` -- top-level (read-only) directory containing all source test data used by batch tests, and 

`OSSIM_BATCH_TEST_RESULTS` -- location (read-write) where expected results, actual results, and log files are written.

The expected results need to be populated the first time through for your platform. This is accomplished by running ossim-batch-test with the option to save ("accept") the results as the new, expected results:

`ossim-batch-test --accept-test <test-configuration-file.kwl>`

There is one composite configuration called `super-test.kwl` that instructs ossim-batch-test to run all individual tests found in this directory.
