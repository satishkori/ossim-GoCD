# GoCD-build
GoCD automatically deletes all non-material folders in the pipeline root before fetching materials, even if the stage setting's "Clean Working Directory" is unselected. That setting applies only to specified materials (e.g., the ossim repository). Unfortunately, the "out-of-source" build was being deleted each time the materials were fetched, forcing a new and lengthy build from scratch each time. By placing the generated build files in a separate repo that is also specified as material for the pipeline, GoCD will not delete the build. 

The .gitignore file must contain all files and folders in the build so that no actual fetching occurs (except this README and the .gitignore file itself).
